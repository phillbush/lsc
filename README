NAME
       lsc - list clients

SYNOPSIS
       lsc [-als]

DESCRIPTION
       lsc list clients managed by an EWMH-compliant window manager.  Output
       is one entry per line.

       The options are as follows:

       -a     List the active window whenever it changes.  This option makes
              lsc run indefinitely, watching for changes in the
              _NET_ACTIVE_WINDOW property.

       -l     List in long format (see below).

       -s     Sort by stacking order.  That is, use _NET_CLIENT_LIST_STACKING
              instead of _NET_CLIENT_LIST to get the list of clients.

   The Long Format
       If the -l option is given, the following information is displayed for
       each client: client type and state, client window group ID, client
       transient for window ID, its window ID, and its window name.

       The first space-separated field consists of a sequence of ten
       characters, each one meaning a type state of the client.  If a
       character is - the client is normal or the state does not apply to the
       client.

       • The first character indicates the type of the window.  It can be -
         (the window is normal), k (the window is a dock), b (the window is a
         bar/dock/panel), t (the window is a toolbar), m (the window is a
         menu), u (the window is a small persistent utility window, such as a
         palette or toolbox), s (the window is a splash screen), or d (the
         window is a dialog window).

       • The second character is t to indicate that the window is a transient
         window (WM_TRANSIENT_FOR); m to indicate that the window is a modal
         window (_NET_WM_STATE_MODAL); or T to indicate that the window is
         both transient and modal.

       • The third character is y to indicate that the client is sticky
         (_NET_WM_STATE_STICKY).

       • The fourth character is v to indicate that the client is maximized
         vertically (_NET_WM_STATE_MAXIMIZED_VERT); h to indicate that the
         client is maximized horizontally (_NET_WM_STATE_MAXIMIZED_HORZ); or M
         to indicate that the client is maximized to both directions.

       • The fifth character is s to indicate that the client is shaded
         (_NET_WM_STATE_SHADED).

       • The sixth character is t to indicate that the taskbar should skip the
         client (_NET_WM_STATE_SKIP_TASKBAR); p to indicate that the pager
         should skip the client (_NET_WM_STATE_SKIP_PAGER); or S to indicate
         that both the taskbar and pager should skip the client.

       • The seventh character is h to indicate that the client is
         hidden/minimized (_NET_WM_STATE_HIDDEN).

       • The eighth character is f to indicate that the client is fullscreen
         (_NET_WM_STATE_FULLSCREEN).

       • The ninth character is a to indicate that the client is above others
         (_NET_WM_STATE_ABOVE); or b to indicate that the client is below
         others (_NET_WM_STATE_BELOW);

       • The tenth character is u to indicate that the client has the urgency
         hint set; a to indicate that the client demands attention
         (_NET_WM_STATE_DEMANDS_ATTENTION); or U to indicate that the client
         is both urgent and demands attention.

       • The eleventh character is a to indicate that the client is active
         (_NET_ACTIVE_WINDOW); f to indicate that the client is focused
         (_NET_WM_STATE_FOCUSED); or A to indicate that the client is both
         active and focused.

       The second space-separated field is the ID of the window group that the
       client belongs to.  If the client belongs to no group, this ID is
       0x00000000.

       The third space-separated field is the ID of the window which the
       client is a transient for.  If the client is not a transient window,
       this ID is 0x00000000.

       The fourth space-separated field is the ID of the client window itself.

       The remaining space-separated fields are the name of the client.

ENVIRONMENT
       The followingj environment variables affect the execution of lsc

       DISPLAY
              The display where the window manager is running on.

EXAMPLES
       The following is an example of the output of lsc run with the -l flag.

              ---M------A- 0x00000000 0x00000000 0x01400016 lsc.1 + (~/proj/lsc) - VIM
              ------h----- 0x01800001 0x00000000 0x01800003 [No Name] - VIM
              ---M-------- 0x00000000 0x00000000 0x03e00016 ttyp1: ~/proj/lsc
              ------------ 0x01a00001 0x00000000 0x01a00003 Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia - Mozilla Firefox

       This output indicates that we have a normal Firefox client, two fully
       maximized clients (one of them, is both active and focused), and a
       hidden/minimized client.

       In this example, two clients belong to a group. But no client is
       transient for another window.

BUGS
       I need to add more information to the long format, such as the monitor
       the client is in, the desktop the client belongs to, the client
       geometry, etc.  Thus, the long format may change in future releases to
       include more fields.
